here some text about Web Dev

## Frontend:
A front-end developer **builds the front-end portion of websites and web applications**—the part users see and interact with. A front-end developer creates websites and applications using web languages such as **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that allow users to access and interact with the site or app.
## Backend:
Back-end developers are **the experts who build and maintain the mechanisms that process data and perform actions on websites**. Unlike front-end developers, who control everything you can see on a website, back-end developers are involved in data storage, security, and other server-side functions that you cannot see.
Back-end developers must be familiar with many kinds of tools and frameworks, including languages such as **Python, Java, and Ruby**. They make sure the back-end performs quickly and responsively to front-end user requests.

> The back end refers to **parts of a computer application or a program's code that allow it to operate and that cannot be accessed by a user**. Most data and operating syntax are stored and accessed in the back end of a computer system.

## Server Client Communication:

**Clients and servers exchange messages in a request–response messaging pattern**. The client sends a request, and the server returns a response. This exchange of messages is an example of inter-process communication.
